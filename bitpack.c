 *  Parameters: 
 *    1. word -- an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the binary word to be

 *
 *  Returns: An unsigned 64-bit integer representing the word shifted to the 
 *           left by the specified number of bits.
 *
 *  Effects: It is a Checked Runtime Error if the number of bits to be
